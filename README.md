### Data structures and algorithms

This repo houses the data structures and algorithms im writing to get a better understanding of them

#### Data structures
* String
* Bag
* Array
* singly linked list
* range

### Notes
**String** the string ds is fairly decent as it contains some C++23 methods and a lot of common string methods that std::string does not have although i cant say much about the quality of their implementations
